# EmergencyBot

Have you ever felt unsafe walking alone? To resolve this, an app was created that would allow people to feel like they had some sort of safety net when they might be going into dangerous situations (e.g. walking home late from a class, going somewhere alone, etc.)

EmergencyBot is an app that offers a faster way to save your life, by allowing users an easily accessible way to message contacts with necessary information regarding their location, thus allowing them to receive help faster. 

####Features:
- personalized messaging
- cancellable delay after pressing button to prevent false alarm
- user accounts, allowing cross device access
- crowd messaging for normal use

####Improvements:
- manipulation of volume buttons or other hardware shortcuts for faster response time to danger
